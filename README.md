# Hi, I'm Jack

I'm a full-stack web developer, most proficient in PHP and TypeScript.
I have a 2:1 MSci in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham, and a general enjoyment and aptitude for problem-solving.
In my spare time I like watching sports - rugby league and American football in particular - and playing video games.
Groundbreaking I know.
