# Hi, I'm Jack

I'm a web developer currently working for [We Are Sweet](https://www.wearesweet.co.uk/) in a primarily backend-focussed role.
I have a 2:1 MSci in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham, and a general enjoyment and aptitude for problem-solving.
In my spare time I like watching sports - rugby league and American football in particular - and playing video games.
Groundbreaking I know.

I am also in dire need of a new headshot - to the left is a photo from mid-late 2017 and is in no way reflective of my current hairline.
